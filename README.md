## How to Run the Development Server

To set up and run the development server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TediSina/TrinityChat.git
    cd ammaf
    ```

2. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment**

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set the environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project then set the variables down below (set the default values for SQLite3):

    ```env
    SECRET_KEY = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE'
    GEMINI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'
    DB_ENGINE = 'YOUR_DATABASE_ENGINE_HERE' # Default: 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'
    DB_NAME = 'YOUR_DATABASE_NAME_HERE' # Default: ''
    DB_USER = 'YOUR_DATABASE_USER_HERE' # Default: ''
    DB_PASSWORD = 'YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD_HERE' # Default: ''
    DB_HOST = 'YOUR_DATABASE_HOST_HERE' # Default: ''
    DB_PORT = 'YOUR_DATABASE_PORT_HERE' # Default: ''
    ```

    python manage.py runserver
    ```

9. **Access the Website**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view the website.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python and Django installed on your system.
- Tailwind CSS and daisyUI are pre-configured with Django-Tailwind.
- Any additional configurations or environment variables required for development should be specified in the `.env` file (e.g. `SECRET_KEY` & `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- The Tailwind and Django development servers need to be run side by side (at the same time).
